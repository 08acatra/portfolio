*Platform: PC/Mobile
*Tech Used: C#, Unity3D, Unity Editor Library, Hansoft, SVN Version Control, HTML5, CSS, JS jQuery
*Role: Network Programmer, Mobile Programmer, Web Developer

Ascend was an ambitious project, a trek into the narrative exploration genre along with a required mobile component made this a challenge, even among a team of 30+ individuals. I focused on the network programming using Unity's new network socket API, creating a system to send data back and forth as needed in an efficient manner.

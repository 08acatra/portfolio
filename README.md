I am a programmer for interactive media. Always looking to absorb the next piece of knowledge, I stumbled upon programming in high school and decided to pursue the craft at Columbia College Chicago.

* September 2015 - May 2016
* Platform: PC/Mobile
* Tech Used: C#, Unity3D, Unity Editor Library, Hansoft, SVN Version Control, HTML5, CSS, JS jQuery
* Role: Network Programmer, Mobile Programmer, Web Developer

Ascend was an ambitious project, a trek into the narrative exploration genre along with a required mobile component made this a challenge, even among a team of 30+ individuals. I focused on the network programming using Unity's new network socket API, creating a system to send data back and forth as needed in an efficient manner.

I was brought onto the project as an intern after the pre-production stages. A majority of my time was spent with the lead network programmer to troubleshoot networking issues with the game but was also tasked small assignments and bug fixing to polish up the final project.

[Worlds VR Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waF5v2w80Qg "Video Demo")
* November 2014 - December 2014
* Platform: PC, Oculus VR
* Tech Used: HTML5, JS, WebGL, three.js
* Role: Programmer

The Worlds VR was an experiment in understanding VR technology using the idea "What if we put you inside an audio visualizer?". With a team consisting of a designer, music engineer, and myself we set out to understand the still fledgling Oculus technology, WebGL, and music interaction. Unfortunately the libraries we used have fallen into disarray but not before we were able to capture a video of the application working.
